\title{Generate data}
\usage{
generate_norm(X, b, d = 1, ymax = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{An n x p design matrix}

\item{b}{A vector of p regression coefficients}

\item{d}{A scalar controlling the coarseness of the support, where d = 1
means integer support (see details)}

\item{ymax}{An upper bound on the observable response (see details)}
}
\value{
A matrix with n rows and 2 columns; the first is the lower endpoint
 of the observed interval and the second the upper endpoint (see details)
}
\description{
{
The generated responses are discretized and truncated from a standard normal
generalized linear model.
 }
}
\details{
{
  Data are generated by (i) draw y ~ Normal(-x*b), (ii) replace y by floor(y
  / d) * d, and (iii) replace every element of y greater than ymax by ymax and
  every element y smaller than -ymax by -ymax; this gives the lower endpoint 
  of the interval. Observe that the operation floor(y / d) * d sets y to the 
  nearest smaller multiple of d.

  The upper endpoint of the observed interval is yupp = y + d, unless y =
  (+/-)ymax in which case yupp = (+/-)Inf.
