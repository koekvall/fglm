# Elastic-Net Regularized Regression Models for Interval Censored Responses

Accelerated proximal gradient descent (~FISTA) and proximal Newton algorithms
for fitting elastic-net regularized regression models for interval censored
responses. Efficiently computes the solution path for a sequence of penalty
parameters. Currently supports (censored) Exponential distribution with log-link
and Normal distribution with identity link.
