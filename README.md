# Elastic-Net Regularized Regression Models for Interval Censored Responses

Accelerated proximal gradient descent (~FISTA) and proximal Newton algorithms
for fitting elastic-net regularized interval censored, categorical, or flexible finite-support regression. Efficiently computes the solution path for a sequence of penalty
parameters.
